# E-Commerce Sales Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to extract meaningful business insights using Python (EDA) and Power BI (Dashboarding).
The objective is to understand sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and business trends to support data-driven business decisions.
## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (EDA)
- Power BI (Dashboard Creation)
- GitHub (Version Control & Portfolio Hosting)
## Insights from Analysis
### Sales & Profit Trends
- Monthly analysis shows seasonal variations in both sales and profit.
- Some months generate high sales but relatively lower profit, indicating discount-driven revenue patterns.
### Category Performance
- Electronics, Home Decor, Furniture, and Clothing contribute the highest sales.
- Certain categories generate high revenue but lower profit margins, highlighting the need for pricing and cost optimization.
### Product Insights
- Top 10 products contribute a significant portion of total revenue.
- Sales concentration in limited products shows dependency risk and product portfolio imbalance.
### Payment Mode Analysis
Payments are evenly distributed across:
- UPI
- Debit Card
- Credit Card
- COD
- Net Banking
This reflects strong digital adoption and multi-channel payment behavior.
### Discount Analysis
- High discounts in specific sub-categories negatively impact profit margins.
- Discount-heavy categories show high sales volume but lower profitability.
### Regional Performance
- Sales are distributed across East, West, North, and South regions.
- This indicates balanced geographic demand and strong regional market potential.
### Business Recommendations
- Optimize discount strategies to improve profit margins
- Focus on high-profit categories, not only high-sales categories
- Apply region-based marketing and promotions
